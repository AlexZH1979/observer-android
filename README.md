    <h4>Application description</h4>
      <p>
        Appliction use Shared References HW (<a href="https://github.com/zagart/observer-android/blob/hw05102016sharedpref/README.md">README.md</a>) as base, but have unique story and several UI additions. Compile it, 
        run it and be happy!
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed like a good idea for me to do something like this. Idea appeared suddenly and it has grew with every 
        new line of code. And funny comments from code pointed just for me got their UI.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think someone maybe have found it funny :)
     </p>

    <h4>How it works</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>If info about your agreements empty, then at startup you'll go the A1 activity.</li>
        <li>If info exists then you'll go to the main activity.</li>
        <li>You can agree or not with agreement with click on buttons YES/NO and go to the next agreements by pressing NEXT.</li>
        <li>You can't pass further until status of your answer marked as "unknown", but you still can return and change previous answers.</li>
        <li>At main activity you can just exit appliction or additionally reject all you agreements by pressing RUN AWAY/
          REJECT ALL AND RUN AWAY. Or you can complete little task of happiness by pressing HELP!
         </li>
      </ul>
  </li>

    <h4>Known issues</h4>
     <p>
       Application absolutely do not adapted for rotating, so I just turned off this opportunity. Just because I do not have enough
       time to correct it now. This also applied to low quantity of features.
     </p>
     <p>
       Object-oriented model wasn't deeply thought. Methods in classes added as needed. 
       As result, classes may have malformed structure.
     </p>
     <p>
      The rest of problems commented right in code.
